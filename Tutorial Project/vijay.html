    <p>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.</p>
    <p>The website UI can be built using various, front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript.

        The back end is written in programming languages like Java or Python. Further, a good web application would need scalability, event handling, and routing, which are usually handled by libraries and frameworks like SpringBoot or Django.
        
        The back end also consists of logic that can connect the application to other services and databases. For example, all the user and transaction data is stored in a database through specific drivers handled on the back end.</p>
        <h1>Lets Divide Full Stack into 3 parts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Frontend</li>
            <li>Backend</li>
            <li>Database</li>
        </ul>
